Hi Andy. :) 


<a href="http://www.mercycorps.org/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/adaptive-image/public/careers_page.jpg?itok=s8ecGLiy"><img src="http://dailyemerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/131019.mca_.ODE_.fbc_.WSU_.0157.jpg"/></a>

 <div class="julianne"><p>For many University of Oregon students and faculty getting to and from campus is a daily necessity, but changing their means of transportation, people can save money and win prizes. Hosted by Drive Less Connect, the Oregon Drive Less Challenge gives away regional and state-wide prizes to Oregonians who travel in a more sustainable way. From Oct. 21 to Nov. 1 the Drive Less Challenge set a goal to eliminate half a million vehicle miles traveled in 12 days.</p></div>

<p>"This is the first year we've ever done a state wide challenge," said Marc Tobia, Oregon Representative. "We wanted to try something new and bring everyone together to reduce the amount of miles we drive." Resulting from the success of several regional challenges across the state, the Drive Less Challenge gives people a window of time to try out different commute options and find what works for them.</p>

<div class="andy"><p>After registering online, participants log each non drive alone trip they take and win prizes within their region and state. "Trips are anything from carpooling with somebody to taking a bus, train, or bike," notes Tobia. "Even skateboarding is a trip."</p></div>
